# Data Governance

## Rationale:
Data governance is essential for managing an organization's data assets effectively and responsibly, providing a framework that includes policies, procedures, and standards to ensure data quality, security, and compliance. It promotes data accuracy, consistency, and reliability, supports regulatory adherence, enhances security, and streamlines data management processes, thereby improving operational efficiency and accountability. By implementing robust data governance, organizations can leverage data as an asset to support informed decision-making, drive innovation, and achieve long-term success.

## Key Components:
#### 1. Key Quality Indicators (KQIs):
- Metrics that measure the quality of data and processes, ensuring they meet predefined standards and support business objectives.

#### 2. Key Data Elements (KDEs):
- Critical pieces of data that are essential for business operations and decision-making, requiring accurate and consistent management.

#### 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Metrics used to evaluate the success of an organization or a particular activity in achieving its objectives, often related to efficiency, effectiveness, and quality.

#### 4. Data Risk and Privacy Metrics:
- Measures that assess the potential risks associated with data handling and ensure compliance with privacy regulations to protect sensitive information.

#### 5. Policies and Processes:
- Established guidelines and procedures that govern data management practices, ensuring consistency, compliance, and alignment with organizational goals.

#### 6. Shared Business Vocabulary and Semantics:
- A common language and understanding of terms and definitions used across the organization to ensure clarity and consistency in data communication.

#### 7. Data Quality Rules:
- Specific criteria and standards that data must meet to be considered accurate, complete, and reliable, supporting high-quality data management and usage.

## Considerations:
1. **Server Capability**
- `Purpose:` Understand server capabilities for running queries.
- `Benefit:` Optimize server performance and query efficiency.

2. **Peak Usage Times**
- `Purpose:` Identify peak usage times.
- `Benefit:` Manage resources and schedule maintenance during low usage periods.

3. **SQL Data Logs**
- `Purpose:` Access logs for results, run time, data transferred, max/min transfer speed.
- `Benefit:` Monitor and improve data transfer efficiency.

4. **Error Escalation**
- `Purpose:` Prioritize data integrity errors/concerns to the SLS team.
- `Benefit:` Ensure timely resolution of critical data issues.

5. **Inclusion in Meetings**
- `Purpose:` Ensure inclusion in digital health meetings.
- `Benefit:` Foster collaboration and alignment on data governance practices.

6. **Document Processes**
- `Purpose:` Future-proof similar events.
