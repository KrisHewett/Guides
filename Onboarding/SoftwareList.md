## Software List (Onboarding)

A concise, authoritative list of approved software for new starters. IT centrally provisions software; raise requests via Marval (see "How to request" below).

Purpose: quick reference for new staff and managers — names, purpose, recommended version and any provisioning notes.

Quick links:

- Machine-readable list: [Onboarding/SoftwareList.csv](Onboarding/SoftwareList.csv)
- Provisioning scripts: [provisioning-scripts/README.md](provisioning-scripts/README.md)

Standard entry fields (keep short): Name | Purpose | Recommended version | License | Provisioning notes | Marval ticket | Approval owner

How to request software

- Raise a Marval ticket with: application name, intended use, required version (if any), business justification, and any integrations/permissions required.

Guidance & principles

- IT will normally provision the latest tested x64 builds unless a pinned version is required for compatibility.
- Do not install enterprise-managed apps locally — request via Marval.
- For paid software include cost centre and approval details in the ticket.

Categories (examples)

- Productivity & Office (Office, Visio, Acrobat)
- Communication & Collaboration (Outlook, Teams)
- Browsers & Web Tools (Edge, Chrome)
- Data & Development (VS Code, Power BI, Python, R, SSMS)
- Utilities & Admin (Notepad++, file tools)

Packaging checklist (summary)

- Verify vendor signature/checksum
- Provide install/uninstall commands and required switches
- Test install/uninstall on supported OS versions
- Document post-install configuration and permissions

If you need a full vendor policy or security review, note that in the Marval request and IT/security will advise.
