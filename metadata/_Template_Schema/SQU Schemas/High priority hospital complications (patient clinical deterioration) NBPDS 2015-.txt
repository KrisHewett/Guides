Identifying and definitional attributes
Metadata item type:	Data Set Specification
METEOR identifier:	586966
Registration status:	Health, Standard 04/09/2015

DSS type:	Data Set Specification (DSS)
Scope:	The High priority hospital complications (patient clinical deterioration) National best practice data set (NBPDS) 2015- covers 3 types of events where unplanned urgent care is provided to admitted hospital patients.
The 3 types of events involve:
•	unplanned returns to the operating theatre
•	unplanned admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
•	hospital rapid response team (RRT) calls.
This NBPDS is designed for use at the local hospital level to assist in hospitals' monitoring of the safety and quality of the health care they provided to admitted patients. The data elements aim to standardise how this information is captured.
This NBPDS is designed to be recorded for each individual episode of admitted patient care. It is designed to capture the relevant events if they occur during the episode of care and are related to care provided in the episode. It is not designed to record the events if they occurred in the episode but were related to care provided in a previous episode (for example, when a patient is transferred into the hospital for ICU care) or to record events related to care provided in the episode of care but occurring in a subsequent episode of care (for example, when a patient is transferred out to another hospital for ICU care).
This NBPDS is designed for both public and private hospitals.
