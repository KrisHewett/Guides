# Metadata item types
---
There are twelve types of metadata items used in METEOR:
- Classification scheme: An official terminological system, recognised and endorsed by a national or international body, that is used to classify data.
- Data element -The basic unit of identifiable and definable information created by combining a data element concept and a value domain.
- Data element concept: A concept created for the purposes of defining a data element by the union of an object class and a property.
- Data set specification: A collection of data elements which are collected as a set.
- Glossary item: A glossary item defines the meaning of a term within a specific context.
- Indicator: A statistical measure used to describe the progress or performance of the health or welfare system. This may be linked to a population or a number related to the provision of goods and services-output.
- Indicator set: A single or multi-word designation assigned to a set of indicators.
- Object class: Represents an entity, place or event that is of interest and needs to be described.
- Outcome area: A statement that specifically defines the target, standard or the ideal result of the indicator, against which performance is to be assessed.
- Property: A characteristic of the object class of interest.
- Quality statement: A statement of multiple quality dimensions for the purpose of assessing the quality of the data for reporting against the Indicator.
- Value domain: A set of permissible values by which a data element can be implemented. The value domain may be enumerated (e.g. a code) or non-enumerated (e.g. a total).
